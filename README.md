This is a 3-in-1 project:

1. A real product for DJs to help with identifying BPM (beats per minute) of the track currently playing.
2. A real-world demo and a playground for Azure Static Web Apps service.
3. Proof of concept for a Progressive Web App (PWA) driven by Workbox-powered service worker.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

The service worker is not in use in the development environment.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

The production-ready service worker will also be generated.
